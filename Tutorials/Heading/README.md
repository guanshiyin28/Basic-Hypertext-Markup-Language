# HTML Headings Tutorial

This tutorial explains how to use HTML headings, which are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags. The `<h1>` tag defines the most important heading, while the `<h6>` tag defines the least important heading.

## Example

```html
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is heading 6</h6>
```

You can use headings to create a hierarchical structure for your content. It is important to use headings in the correct order to maintain accessibility and SEO best practices.
